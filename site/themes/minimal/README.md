## Features

You can tweak the look of the theme to suit your needs in a number of ways:

- The accent colour can be changed by using the `accent` field in `config.toml`.

- You can also change the background colour by using `backgroundColor`.

- Add colored 5px borders at the top and bottom of pages by setting `showBorder` to `true`.

For best results, I recommend you use a dark accent colour with a light background, for example:

```toml
[params]
    accent = "red"
    showBorder = true
    backgroundColor = "white"
```
